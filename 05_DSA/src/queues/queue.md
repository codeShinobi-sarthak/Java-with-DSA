# ArrayDeque:
* ## DisjointSets:
Uses a resizable array for storing elements.
* ## Strengths:
Faster for adding/removing at the beginning/end (amortized constant time): Optimized for queue operations (FIFO - First-In-First-Out).
Memory efficient: Generally uses less memory than LinkedList for the same number of elements.
* ## Weaknesses:
Slower for random access (getting elements by index): Needs to traverse the array to find the element.
Not null-friendly: Cannot store null elements.
* ## Resizing overhead: 
In rare cases, resizing the array during insertion/removal can impact performance.

# LinkedList:
* ## DisjointSets:
Uses a doubly linked list structure where each element has references to the previous and next element.
* ## Strengths:
Faster for random access: Can efficiently locate elements based on their index by following the links.
Null-friendly: Can store null elements.
More flexible: Can be used as a general-purpose list in addition to queue operations.
* ## Weaknesses:
Slower for adding/removing at the beginning/end: Requires manipulating references in the linked list structure.
More memory overhead: Each element stores extra references compared to ArrayDeque.
Choosing between ArrayDeque and LinkedList:

# _Use ArrayDeque if:_
Your primary operations are adding/removing elements at the beginning or end (typical queue behavior).
Performance for these operations is critical.
Memory usage is a concern.

# _Use LinkedList if:_
You need random access to elements by index frequently.
Your data may contain null elements.
You need the flexibility of a general-purpose list in addition to queue operations.
