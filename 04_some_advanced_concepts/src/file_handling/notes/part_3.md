### 🧠 Categorization of File Handling

File handling in Java is broadly categorized based on **how data is read/written**:

---

## ✍️ 1. **Character Streams**
> For **text data** like `.txt`, `.csv`, or `.xml`

These read/write **character by character** — ideal when you're working with **human-readable content**.

### ✅ Classes:
| Purpose | Unbuffered        | Buffered            |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Read    | `FileReader`      | `BufferedReader`    |
| Write   | `FileWriter`      | `BufferedWriter`    |

### 🔍 Use Case:
Reading or writing text, like logs, configuration files, or reports.

```java
BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("notes.txt"));
writer.write("learning Java File Handling made easy! ✨");
writer.close();
```

---

## 🧊 2. **Byte Streams**
> For **binary data** like images, videos, PDFs

These read/write **byte by byte** — perfect when the content isn't human-readable.

### ✅ Classes:
| Purpose | Unbuffered            | Buffered                  |
|---------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| Read    | `FileInputStream`     | `BufferedInputStream`     |
| Write   | `FileOutputStream`    | `BufferedOutputStream`    |

### 🔍 Use Case:
Copying or modifying images, transferring binary files, etc.

```java
BufferedInputStream in = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream("photo.jpg"));
BufferedOutputStream out = new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("copy.jpg"));

int byteData;
while ((byteData = in.read()) != -1) {
    out.write(byteData);
}
in.close();
out.close();
```

## 💡 Buffered vs Unbuffered — What's the Deal?

Buffered versions add a **temporary memory layer (buffer)** which makes them **faster and more efficient** by minimizing I/O operations.

> ⚡ **Always prefer buffered classes** when performance matters or you're reading large files.

---

## 🛠️ 3. **Utility-Based Classes**
These don't belong strictly to char/byte streams, but make file handling **easier**:

### ✨ `PrintWriter` — for easy writing
```java
PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter("log.txt");
pw.println("Easy writing to file 🖊️");
pw.close();
```

### 🔍 `Scanner` — for easy reading
```java
Scanner sc = new Scanner(new File("log.txt"));
while (sc.hasNextLine()) {
    System.out.println(sc.nextLine());
}
sc.close();
```

 Character Streams                  Byte Streams
     |                                   |
  FileReader                        FileInputStream
  FileWriter                        FileOutputStream
     |                                   |
BufferedReader                    BufferedInputStream
BufferedWriter                    BufferedOutputStream
     |                                   |
  Utility: Scanner, PrintWriter, etc.
