The **Java Object Model** refers to how **objects, classes, and memory** are structured and managed in Java. It helps you understand how Java works internally—especially when it comes to memory allocation, inheritance, polymorphism, and method calls.

Let’s break it down in a simple and structured way:

---

## 🧠 Java Object Model (JOM)

### 🧩 1. **Class and Object Basics**
- **Class**: Blueprint or template.
- **Object**: Instance of a class created using `new`.

```java
class Car {
    String brand;
    void drive() { System.out.println("Driving..."); }
}
Car myCar = new Car();  // Object
```

### 🗃️ 2. **Memory Areas in Java**
| Area           | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Heap**       | Stores objects and instance variables |
| **Stack**      | Stores method calls and local variables |
| **Method Area**| Stores class-level info (like static vars, method code) |
| **PC Register**| Stores address of current instruction |
| **Native Method Stack** | Used for native (non-Java) method calls |

---

### 🧱 3. **Structure of a Java Object**
Each object has:
- **Header**: Contains identity hashcode, GC info, class metadata pointer
- **Instance Data**: Actual fields/variables
- **Padding**: For memory alignment (in JVM)

---

### 🔄 4. **Class Layout in JVM**
A compiled class includes:
- Field definitions
- Method definitions
- Constant pool (for string literals, symbols)
- Method table (for dynamic dispatch)
- Bytecode instructions

---

### 👪 5. **Inheritance in Object Model**
- Java supports **single inheritance** (class level).
- All classes extend `Object` by default.
- Method overriding is resolved using **v-tables** (virtual method tables).

---

### 🔍 6. **Dynamic Dispatch (Runtime Polymorphism)**
When a method is overridden, the decision of which method to call is made **at runtime**.

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() { System.out.println("Animal sound"); }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() { System.out.println("Dog barks"); }
}
Animal a = new Dog();  
a.sound();  // Output: Dog barks
```

### 💡 7. **Why Java Object Model Matters**
- Helps you understand memory efficiency
- Key for performance tuning
- Crucial for JVM-based optimization
- Needed for understanding garbage collection

---

### 📌 Key Points Summary:
- Everything in Java is **object-oriented**.
- Memory is separated into **heap**, **stack**, and **method area**.
- Objects have headers + fields.
- Java uses **dynamic dispatch** for overridden methods.
- All objects are eventually **garbage collected**.
