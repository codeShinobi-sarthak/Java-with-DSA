# Java DSA & Data Structures Practice Repository

This repository is dedicated to my practice and study of Java, focusing on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It includes implementations of various data structures, algorithm solutions, and LeetCode problem solutions.

## Contents

- **Data Structures:**  
  Implementations for linked lists, trees, graphs, stacks, queues, and more.
  
- **Algorithms:**  
  Solutions covering sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and other algorithmic challenges.
  
- **LeetCode Questions:**  
  Step-by-step solutions to popular problems found on LeetCode.

Each module/package is designed to allow independent execution of individual classes (with a `main()` method) using IntelliJ IDEA or any Java IDE.

## How to Run

Simply open the project in your IDE, navigate to any Java file with a `main()` method, and run it directly.
